NOTES:

This is a simple exercise.

It's goal is to show some programming with Spring Boot and Java to call an external API.

It contains some tests, and all responses are fake.

I have a simple HTTP endpoint running at  http://dummyapi-env.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/dummy/v.10/query

See https://github.com/joaomiguelpereira/dummyhttpapi

This small exercise only handle some input and call a fake api.

Please see more notes provided.
